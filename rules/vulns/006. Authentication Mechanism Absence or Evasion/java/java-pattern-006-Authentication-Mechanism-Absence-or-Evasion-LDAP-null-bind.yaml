    severity: WARNING
    message: >
      Possible LDAP null bind: LdapManager.canAuthenticate is called with a user
      and password without ensuring the password is non-empty. If the LDAP
      server allows unauthenticated bind, this can lead to an auth bypass.
    pattern: $MGR.canAuthenticate($USER, $PASS)
