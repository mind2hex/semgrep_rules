    message: The source code repository contains sensitive information such as
      usernames, passwords, email addresses and IP addresses, among others.
      Alternatively, while values may be password=123 o aws.secret_key=test,
      they reveal the bad practice of storing sensitive information in the
      repository with no encryption, and sooner or later they can be replaced
      for real sensitive values.
