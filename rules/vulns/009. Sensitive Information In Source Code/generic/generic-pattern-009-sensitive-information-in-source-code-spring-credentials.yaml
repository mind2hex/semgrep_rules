      **Possible Sensitive Configuration Found in .properties File**

      This finding indicates that a **Spring `.properties` file** may contain
      **sensitive information** such as database credentials or connection URLs.

      Hardcoding secrets in configuration files is a **high-risk security
      practice**, as it may allow unauthorized access to databases or other
      systems if the repository is exposed.
